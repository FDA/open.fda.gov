  - "The primary purpose for maintaining the CVM ADE database is to provide an early warning or signaling system to CVM for adverse effects not detected during pre-market testing of FDA-approved animal drugs and for monitoring the performance of drugs not approved for use in animals. Information from these ADE reports is coded and entered into a computerized FDA/CVM ADE database. CVM scientists use the ADE database to make decisions about product safety which may include changes to the label or other regulatory action."
