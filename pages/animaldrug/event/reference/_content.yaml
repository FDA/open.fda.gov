- "## About"
- "The openFDA animal drug adverse event API returns data from the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), which collects information on adverse animal drug experiences and product/manufacturing defects. An adverse event is submitted via FDA Form 1932 to report any adverse drug experience (ADE) associated with the use of an animal drug. This includes adverse drug reactions, lack of effectiveness, and product and manufacturing defects."
- "Section 514.80 (b) (21 CFR 514.80(b)) of FDA regulations requires applicants of approved new animal drug applications (NADAs) and approved abbreviated new animal drug applications (ANADAs) to report adverse drug events and product and manufacturing defects. This continuous monitoring of approved NADAs and ANADAs afford the primary means by which CVM obtains information regarding potential problems with the safety and efficacy of marketed approved new animal drugs as well as potential product/manufacturing problems."
- "CVM relies on adverse event reports to facilitate a determination as to whether there may be grounds for suspending or withdrawing approval of an animal drug application. The information contained in these reports also assists CVM in working with firms to minimize ADEs due to manufacturing problems, previously unidentified or uncommon side effects, and off-label use of animal drugs."
- "To read more about the FDA’s CVM and animal drug adverse event reporting, see [Animal & Veterinary Safety & Health](http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/default.htm)."
- disclaimer:
  - "Animal drug AE data does have limitations. There is no certainty that the reported event (adverse event or medication error) was actually due to the product. FDA does not require that a causal relationship between a product and event be proven, and reports do not always contain enough detail to properly evaluate an event."
  - "Further, FDA does not receive reports for every adverse event or medication error that occurs with a product. Many factors can influence whether or not an event will be reported, such as the time a product has been marketed and publicity about an event."
  - "Submission of a safety report does not constitute an admission that medical personnel, user facility, importer, distributor, manufacturer or product caused or contributed to the event. The information in these reports has not been scientifically or otherwise verified as to a cause and effect relationship and cannot be used to estimate the incidence of these events."
- "### Responsible use of the data"
- "Adverse event reports submitted to FDA do not undergo extensive validation or verification. Therefore, **a causal relationship cannot be established between veterinary medicinal product (VMP) and reactions listed in a report.** While a suspected relationship *may* exist, it is not medically validated and should not be the sole source of information for clinical decision making or other assumptions about the safety or efficacy of a VMP."
- "Additionally, it is important to remember that adverse event reports represent a small percentage of total usage numbers of a VMP. Common VMPs may have a higher number of adverse events due to the higher total number of animals being given the product. In recent years the FDA has undertaken efforts to increase collection of adverse events. Increases in the total number of adverse events is likely caused by improved reporting."

- "## Anatomy of a response"
- "This is a simulated openFDA API return for a non-`count` query. It is divided into two high-level sections, `meta` and `results`."
- example: anatomy
- "### Meta"
- "For non-`count` queries, the `meta` section includes a disclaimer, a link to the openFDA data license, and information about the results that follow."
- example: meta
- fields:
  - meta
- "### Results"
- "For non-`count` queries, the `results` section includes matching animal drugs adverse event reports returned by the API."
- "Each animal drug adverse event report consists of these major sections:"
- ul:
  - "**Header:** General information about the adverse event"
  - "**Animal Information:** Details on the animal that experienced the event, such as breed, weight, sex, etc."
  - "**Drugs:** Information on the drugs taken while the event was experienced"
  - "**Reactions:** Information on the reactions experienced by the patient"
- "## Field-by-field reference"
- "### Header"
- "General information about the adverse event."
- example: header
- fields:
  - unique_aer_id_number
  - report_id
  - original_receive_date
  - receiver
  - primary_reporter
  - secondary_reporter
  - type_of_submission
  - type_of_information
  - serious_ae
  - domestic_or_foreign
- "### Animal"
- "Information about the animal(s) in the adverse event report."
- example: animal
- fields:
  - number_of_animals_treated
  - number_of_animals_affected
  - animal
  - health_assessment_prior_to_exposure
- "#### Drugs"
- "Information on the drugs taken while the event was experienced."
- example: drugs
- fields:
  - drug
- "#### openFDA fields"
- "Different datasets use different drug identifiers—brand name, generic name, NDC, etc. It can be difficult to find the same drug in different datasets. And some identifiers, like pharmacologic class, are useful search filters but not available in all datasets."
- "openFDA features harmonization of drug identifiers, to make it easier to connect adverse event report records to other veterinary medicinal product information. A majority of adverse event records have a least one `openfda` section. Because the harmonization process requires an exact match, some veterinary medicinal products cannot be harmonized in this fashion—for instance, if the product NDC is missing. Some products will have `openfda` sections, while others never will, if there was no match during the harmonization process."
- example: openfda
- fields:
  - drug.openfda
  - drug.manufacturer.registration_number
- disclaimer:
  - "A single drug product listed in an adverse event report may have multiple associated manufacturer names, NDCs, and SPLs in a corresponding `openfda` section. That is because the drug may have multiple manufacturers, packagers, dosage forms, etc. Their inclusion in the `openfda` section does not mean that they had any connection to the adverse event. The ordering of data in `openfda` fields is not significant."
- "#### Reactions"
- "Information on the reactions experienced."
- example: reactions
- fields:
  - onset_date
  - duration
  - reaction
  - time_between_exposure_and_onset
  - treated_for_ae
- "datasets"
