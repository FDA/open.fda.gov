- "## About"
- Note that the effective time of labeling is used to calculate how current data is. Some labeling is dated in the future, and that is reflected in the calculation above.
- The openFDA drug product labeling API returns data from the [FDA Structured Product Labeling](https://open.fda.gov/data/spl/) (SPL) dataset. This dataset contains structured documentation about regulated products, submitted by manufacturers to FDA. OpenFDA uses the latest available bulk downloads, which have the latest version of every structured product labeling document for products that are actively marked.
- "### What is structured product labeling?"
- Drug manufacturers and distributors submit documentation about their products to FDA. Labeling contains a summary of the essential scientific information needed for the safe and effective use of the drug.
- The openFDA drug product labeling API returns data from these submissions for all animal drugs. The labeling is broken into sections such as indications for use, purpose, adverse reactions, etc. There is considerable variation between drug products, since the information required for safe and effective use varies with the unique characteristics of each drug.

- "## Anatomy of a response"
- "This is a simulated openFDA API return for a non-`count` query. It is divided into two high-level sections, `meta` and `results`."
- example: anatomy
- "### Meta"
- "For non-`count` queries, the `meta` section includes a disclaimer, a link to the openFDA data license, and information about the results that follow."
- example: meta
- fields:
  - meta.disclaimer
  - meta.license
  - meta.last_updated
  - meta.results.skip
  - meta.results.limit
  - meta.results.total
- "### Results"
- "For non-`count` queries, the `results` section includes matching animal drug records returned by the API."
- "Each SPL record consists of three sets of fields:"
- ul:
  - "Standard SPL fields, including unique identifiers."
  - "Product-specific fields, the order and contents of which are unique to each product."
  - "An **openfda** section: An annotation with additional product identifiers."
- "#### Field variation"
- Fields vary with the particular product being documented. Some fields are rarely used.
- The specific requirements for content of these fields vary from product to product. General descriptions of the fields are provided below, along with notable exceptions or exceptional cases. Expect variation.
- Some fields are considered by the SPL specification as subsections of other fields, but labeling is not always formatted according to the specification.
- Some labeling features data encoded in the wrong fields. These errors may be corrected in subsequent versions of the product labeling.
- "#### Field order"
- Fields are ordered naturally, as they were found in the original product labeling. Expect variation in field order from product to product.
- "#### Tables"
- Manufacturers sometimes supply product labeling with HTML tables that summarize data. These tables usually accompany other text describing the data. When these tables are encountered, openFDA puts the HTML tables in their own field, with a `_table` suffix.
- example: tables
- "Here are common examples you may see:"
- ul:
  - "`dosage_and_administration` accompanied by `dosage_and_administration_table`"
  - "`spl_unclassified_section` accompanied by `spl_unclassified_section_table`"
- "`_table` fields are each tables that are encoded as HTML, one table per string."
- "## Field-by-field reference"
- Fields and their contents will vary from product to product. The following descriptions are as accurate as possible but do not cover all the potential variation among field contents.
- This page groups fields conceptually for ease of reference. In API results, fields will be ordered naturally as in the product labeling submission.
- "### ID and version"
- "All drug product labeling records contain these fields, which uniquely identify individual records."
- example: id_and_version
- fields:
  - set_id
  - id
  - version
  - effective_time
- "### Adverse effects and interactions"
- example: adverse_effects_and_interactions
- fields:
  - adverse_reactions
  - drug_interactions
  - drug_and_or_laboratory_test_interactions
- "### Clinical pharmacology"
- example: clinical_pharmacology
- fields:
  - clinical_pharmacology
  - mechanism_of_action
  - pharmacodynamics
  - pharmacokinetics
- "### Indications and dosage"
- example: indications_and_dosage
- fields:
  - indications_and_usage
  - contraindications
  - dosage_and_administration
  - dosage_forms_and_strengths
  - purpose
  - description
  - active_ingredient
  - inactive_ingredient
  - spl_product_data_elements
- "### Supply and handling"
- example: supply_and_handling
- fields:
  - how_supplied
  - storage_and_handling
  - safe_handling_warning
- "### Warnings and precautions"
- example: warnings_and_precautions
- fields:
  - boxed_warning
  - safety_warnings
  - precautions
  - warnings
  - general_precautions
- "### Other fields"
- example: other_fields
- fields:
  - laboratory_tests
  - recent_major_changes
  - microbiology
  - package_label_principal_display_panel
  - spl_unclassified_section
- "### openFDA fields"
- example: openfda
- Different datasets use different drug identifiersâ€”brand name, generic name, NDA, NDC, etc. It can be difficult to find the same drug in different datasets. And some identifiers, like pharmacologic class, are useful search filters but not available in all datasets.
- OpenFDA features harmonization of drug identifiers, to make it easier to connect adverse event report records to other drug information. Drug products that appear in ADAE records are joined to the NDC dataset first on NDC drug code. If that is succesful, further links are established to other datasets.

  - openfda
