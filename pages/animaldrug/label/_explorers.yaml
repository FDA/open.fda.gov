countByType:
  params:
  - count the field openfda.product_type (product type).
  query: 'http://ec2-54-86-220-160.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8000/animaldrug/label.json?count=openfda.product_type.exact'
  description:
    - "This query returns a count of the records in the dataset by product type. In this example, the suffix .exact is used, which tells the API to count the unique full phrases in the openfda.product_type field. Without it, the API will count each word in that field individually. That is, OTC ANIMAL DRUG, for example, would be counted as separate values: OTC and ANIMAL and DRUG."
    - "See the [API basics page](https://open.fda.gov/api/) for additional information and tips on how to search the openFDA APIs."
