- '## Downloads'
- 'OpenFDA is designed primarily for real-time queries. However, some applications may require all the data served by an endpoint, or exceed the [query limits](#authentication) or result limit (5000 records per query) in place to promote equitable access and manage load on the system.'
- 'Because [openFDA is open source and its source code is available on GitHub](http://github.com/FDA/openfda/), you can create your own instance of openFDA without these limits and run it on your own server. You can also download the data for any openFDA endpoint, in exactly the same JSON format that query results follow, and build your own custom application that uses these JSON files. Because the format is exactly the same as API query results, you can reuse existing code that you’ve written for applications that process openFDA data. There are two things you should know about these downloads.'
- ul:
  - '**Downloads are broken into parts.** Some endpoints have millions of records. For those endpoints, the data are broken up into many small parts. So while some endpoints have all their data available in a single file, others have dozens of files. Each file is a zipped JSON file.'
  - '**To keep your downloaded data up to date, you need to re-download the data every time it is updated.** Every time an endpoint is updated (which happens on a regular basis), it is possible that every record has changed, due to corrections or enhancements. That means that you cannot simply download "new" files to keep your downloaded version up to date. You need to download all available data files for the endpoint of interest.'
- '### How to download data'
- 'There are three ways to download data from openFDA.'
- ul:
  - '**Download manually.** There’s a downloads section on each endpoint’s openFDA page—for example, [drug adverse event downloads](https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/#downloads). There you can download a sampling of the data, or all of it, one file at a time.'
  - '**Write code to download the data automatically.** Use a special API query (see below) to get a list of all the current data files for each endpoint. The data files are hosted at [http://download.open.fda.gov/](http://download.open.fda.gov/).'
  - '**Synchronize with the openFDA S3 bucket.** Both current and old (archived) data files are available at **s3://download.open.api.gov**, in subdirectories by date (e.g. **s3://download.open.fda.gov/2015-12-19/**). This is the only place that old data files are hosted.'
- '### Download API query'
- example: downloadQuery
- fields:
  - meta
  - results
- 'NOTE For some reason the descriptions are not rendering for the above fields.'
- 'The following fields are present for each **endpoint**—e.g. `results.device.event`.'
- fields:
  - total_records
  - export_date
  - partitions
- 'The following fields are present for each object in the `partitions` list. Remember that each object represents a single file available for download.'
- fields:
  - size_mb
  - records
  - file
- '## Authentication'
- 'An API key is required to make calls to the openFDA API. The key is free of charge. Your use of the API may be subject to certain limitations on access, calls, or use. These limitations are designed to manage load on the system, promote equitable access, and prevent abuse. Here are openFDA’s standard limits:'
- ul:
  - '**With no API key:** 40 requests per minute, per IP address. 1000 requests per day, per IP address.'
  - '**With an API key:** 240 requests per minute, per key. 120000 requests per day, per key.'
- 'If you anticipate usage above the limits provided by an API key, please [contact us](mailto:open@fda.hhs.gov). We’ll work with you to figure out a good solution to your requirements. Signing up for an API key means you agree to our [terms of service.](/terms/)'
- '### Using your API key'
- 'Your API key should be passed to the API as the value of the `api_key` parameter. Include it before other parameters, such as the `search` parameter. For example:'
- '`https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?api_key=yourAPIKeyHere&search=...`'
- "getting-started"
- '## HTTPS requests only'
- 'OpenFDA requires you to use `https://api.fda.gov` for all queries to ensure secure communication.'
- '## OpenFDA fields'
- 'Different datasets use different drug identifiers—brand name, generic name, NDA, NDC, etc. It can be difficult to find the same drug in different datasets. And some identifiers, like pharmacologic class, are useful search filters but not available in all datasets.'
- 'OpenFDA features harmonization on drug identifiers, to make it easier to both search for and understand the drug products returned by API queries. These additional fields are attached to records in all endpoints, if applicable.'
- 'When you query an endpoint, you can search by:'
- ul:
  - 'Fields native to records served by that endpoint.'
  - 'Harmonized `openfda` fields, if they exist.'
- 'OpenFDA does not rewrite original records. These additional fields are annotations, in special `openfda` dictionary of values.'
- disclaimer:
  - '### Limits of openFDA harmonization'
  - 'Not all records have harmonized fields. Because the harmonization process requires an exact match, some drug products cannot be harmonized in this fashion—for instance, if the drug name is misspelled. Some drug products will have <strong>openfda</strong> sections, while others will never, if there was no match during the harmonization process.  Conversely, searching in these fields will only return a subset of records from a given endpoint.'
- 'The documentation below describes fields that you may find in an `openfda` section of an API result. They are organized by the dataset from which they originate.'
- '### NDC'
- 'NDC stands for [National Drug Code.](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ucm142438.htm) The Drug Listing Act of 1972 requires registered drug establishments to provide the FDA with a current list of all drugs manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed by it for commercial distribution. (See Section 510 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) (21 U.S.C. § 360)).'
- 'Drug products are identified and reported using a unique, three-segment number, called the National Drug Code (NDC), which serves as a universal product identifier for drugs.'
- 'Several NDC dataset fields are used to annotate records in openFDA.'
- fields:
  - application_number
  - brand_name
  - dosage_form
  - generic_name
  - manufacturer_name
  - product_ndc
  - product_type
  - route
  - substance_name
- '### SPL'
- 'SPL stands for the [Structured Product Labeling](http://www.fda.gov/forindustry/datastandards/structuredproductlabeling/default.htm) standard approved by Health Level Seven (HL7) and adopted by FDA as a mechanism for exchanging product and facility information. Drug products have associated labels that confirm to the SPL format.'
- 'Several SPL dataset fields are used to annotate records in openFDA.'
- fields:
  - spl_id
  - spl_set_id
  - pharm_class_moa
  - pharm_class_cs
  - pharm_class_pe
  - pharm_class_epc
  - upc
- '### UNII'
- 'UNII stands for [Unique Ingredient Identifier.](http://www.fda.gov/forindustry/datastandards/substanceregistrationsystem-uniqueingredientidentifierunii/default.htm) The overall purpose of the joint FDA/USP Substance Registration System (SRS) is to support health information technology initiatives by generating unique ingredient identifiers (UNIIs) for substances in drugs, biologics, foods, and devices. The UNII is a non- proprietary, free, unique, unambiguous, non semantic, alphanumeric identifier based on a substance’s molecular structure and/or descriptive information.'
- fields:
  - unii
- '### RxNorm'
- '[RxNorm](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/overview.html) is a normalized naming system for generic and branded drugs; and a tool for supporting semantic interoperation between drug terminologies and pharmacy knowledge base systems. The [National Library of Medicine](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/) (NLM) produces RxNorm.'
- fields:
  - rxcui
