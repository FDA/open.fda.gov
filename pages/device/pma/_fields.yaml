        'Subpart B': "“Premarket Approval Application” of the PMA regulation in Part 814 describes PMA amendments and supplements."
        'Subpart E': "“Post Approval Requirements” describes requirements for continuing evaluation (post-approval studies), periodic reporting, and other requirements related to the continued reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of an approved PMA device. The Act defines different types of PMA supplements that are used to request approval of a change to a device that has an approved PMA (see section 737(4) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 379i(4)) for definitions of 180-day supplements, real-time supplements, panel-track supplements)."
        'PMA supplement (180 days)': "Per section 737(4)(C) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 379i(4)(C)), this is a supplement to an approved premarket application or premarket report under section 515 that is not a panel-track supplement and requests a significant change in components, materials, design, specification, software, color additives, or labeling."
        'Special PMA Supplement': "Changes Being Effected Sections 21 CFR 814.39(d)(1) and (d)(2)provide that certain labeling and manufacturing changes that enhance the safety of the device or the safety in the use of the device may be submitted as a supplement marked “Special PMA Supplement – Changes Being Effected.” The Special PMA Supplement is a narrow exception to the general rule that prior FDA approval of changes to a PMA, including the labeling for a device, is a condition of lawful distribution and, therefore, may only be utilized when (1) the applicant has newly acquired safety-related information; (2) the information in question was not previously submitted to the FDA; and (3) the information involves labeling changes that add or strengthen a contraindication, warning, precaution, or information about an adverse reaction for which there is reasonable evidence of a causal association."
        '30-day Notice and 135 PMA Supplement': "Section 515(d) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 360e), as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA)(Pub. L. 105-115), permits a PMA applicant to submit written notification to the agency of a modification to the manufacturing procedure or method of manufacture affecting the safety and effectiveness of the device rather than submitting such change as a PMA supplement. The applicant may distribute the device 30 days after the date on which FDA receives the notice, unless FDA finds such information in the 30-day notice is not adequate, notifies the applicant that the submission has been converted to a 135-day supplement (21 CFR 814.39(f)), and describes further information or action that is required for acceptance of the modification."
        'PMA Manufacturing Site Change Supplement': "After approval of a PMA, an applicant shall submit a PMA supplement for review and approval by FDA before making a change that affects the safety or effectiveness of the device, including a change that uses a different facility or establishment to manufacture, process, or package the device. Such a PMA supplement for a move to a different facility or establishment is called a “manufacturing site change supplement.”"
        'Annual (periodic) Report or 30-day Supplements': "In accordance with 21 CFR 814.82(a)(7), FDA may require as a condition of approval submission to FDA at intervals specified in the approval order of periodic reports containing the information required by 21 CFR 814.84(b). In most cases, after the PMA is approved, the PMA applicant is required to submit reports to FDA annually unless a different time frame is specified in the approval order."
