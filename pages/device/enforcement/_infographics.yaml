  description:
    - "This is the openFDA API endpoint for all device product recalls monitored by the FDA. When an FDA-regulated product is either defective or potentially harmful, recalling that product—removing it from the market or correcting the problem—is the most effective means for protecting the public."
    - "Recalls are almost always voluntary, meaning a company discovers a problem and recalls a product on its own. Other times a company recalls a product after FDA raises concerns. Only in rare cases will FDA request or order a recall. But in every case, FDA's role is to oversee a company's strategy, classify the recalled products according to the level of hazard involved, and assess the adequacy of the recall. Recall information is posted in the Enforcement Reports once the products are classified."
    - "Important note: FDA is working to consolidate medical device recall information."

  description:
    - "Manufacturers and/or distributors may initiate a recall at any time to fulfill their responsibility to protect the public health from products that present a risk of injury or gross deception, or are otherwise defective. Firms may also initiate a recall following notification of a problem by FDA or a state agency, in response to a formal request by FDA, or as ordered by FDA."

- title: "Most device product recalls are Class II"
  short: "Seriousness"
  description:
    - "Recalls are classified into three categories: Class I, a dangerous or defective product that predictably could cause serious health problems or death, Class II, meaning that the product might cause a temporary health problem, or pose only a slight threat of a serious nature, and Class III, a product that is unlikely to cause any adverse health reaction, but that violates FDA labeling or manufacturing laws."
