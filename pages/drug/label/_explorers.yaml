  params:
  - count the field openfda.product_type (product type).

  description:
    - There are more labeling records for over-the-counter (OTC) drugs than prescription drugs.
    - The suffix .exact is required by openFDA to count the unique full phrases in the field openfda.product_type. Without it, the API will count each word in that field individually—HUMAN OTC DRUG would be counted as separate values, HUMAN and OTC and DRUG.
