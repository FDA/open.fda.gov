=======

openFDA is a research project to provide open APIs, raw data downloads, documentation and examples, and a developer community for an important collection of FDA public datasets.

*Please note that openFDA is a beta research project and not for clinical use. While we make every effort to ensure that data and logic are accurate, you should assume all results are unvalidated.*
