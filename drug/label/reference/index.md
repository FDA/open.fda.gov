## About

    https://api.fda.gov/drug/label

{% include api-status-updated.html endpoint="https://api.fda.gov/drug/label.json?" count="effective_time" %}

<small>Note that the `effective_time` of labeling is used to calculate how current data is. Some labeling is dated in the future, and that is reflected in the calculation above.</small>

The openFDA drug product labeling API returns data from the FDA <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/spl/">Structured Product Labeling</a> (SPL) dataset. This dataset contains structured documentation about regulated products, submitted by manufacturers to FDA. OpenFDA uses the latest available bulk downloads, which have the latest version of every structured product labeling document for products that are actively marketed.

### What is structured product labeling?

Drug manufacturers and distributors submit documentation about their products to FDA. Labeling contains a summary of the essential scientific information needed for the safe and effective use of the drug.

The openFDA drug product labeling API returns data from these submissions for both prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. The labeling is broken into sections, such as <em>indications for use</em> (prescription drugs) or <em>purpose</em> (OTC drugs), <em>adverse reactions,</em> and so forth. There is considerable variation between drug products, since the information required for safe and effective use varies with the unique characteristics of each drug product.

### Data downloads

During our beta period, we are investigating the best ways to offer direct downloads of data provided by the API.

There are no plans for the openFDA initiative to change the SPL release protocols. At this time it is anticipated that SPL data will continue to be available from the same site on the same schedule. OpenFDA is a research project to make access to these datasets easier, not replace the current process. The information available through openFDA is not for clinical or production use and is in beta testing. While FDA makes every effort to ensure the data is accurate, it should be assumed that all results are not validated.

{% include api-anatomy.html %}

### Results

For non-`count` queries, the `results` section includes matching SPL records returned by the API.

Each SPL record consists of three sets of fields:

- Standard SPL fields, including unique identifiers.
- Product-specific fields, the order and contents of which are unique to each product. 
- An **openfda** section: An annotation with additional product identifiers, such as UPC and brand name, of the drug products listed in the labeling.

#### Field variation

Fields vary with the particular product being documented. Some fields are rarely used. Most prescription drug product labeling will feature similar fields, and those fields will contain similar content. Over-the-counter (OTC) drug product labeling will generally feature a different set of fields.

The specific requirements for content of these fields vary from product to product. General descriptions of the fields are provided below, along with notable exceptions or exceptional cases. Expect variation.

FDA regulations describe these fields more thoroughly than this documentation. The following documents may be useful for more information about [prescription drug product labeling](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=201.57) and [over-the-counter (OTC) drug product labeling.](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=201.80)

Some fields are considered by the SPL specification as *subsections* of other fields, but labeling is not always formatted according to the specification. For example, information about prescription drugs' potential teratogenic effects are ordinarily encoded in the `teratogenic_effects` field, found after (as a subsection of) the `pregnancy` field. However, some labels combine all the content into the `pregnancy` field and do not have a `teratogenic_effects` field. Again, expect variation.

Some labeling features data encoded in the wrong fields. These errors may be corrected in subsequent versions of the product labeling.

#### Field order

Fields are ordered naturally, as they were found in the original product labeling. Expect variation in field order from product to product.

#### Tables

Manufacturers sometimes supply product labeling with HTML tables that summarize data, such as adverse reactions. These tables usually accompany other text describing the data. When these tables are encountered, openFDA puts the HTML tables in their own field, with a `_table` suffix.

{% highlight javascript %}
"results": [
  {
    ...
    "how_supplied": "...",
    "how_supplied_table": "<table>...</table>"
    ...
  }
{% endhighlight %}

Here are common examples you may see:

 - `drug_interactions` accompanied by `drug_interactions_table`
 - `adverse_reactions` accompanied by `adverse_reactions_table`
 - `how_supplied` accompanied by `how_supplied_table`

`_table` fields
: **list of strings**
: Each table is encoded as HTML, one table per string.

## Field-by-field reference

Fields and their contents will vary from product to product. There are major differences between prescription drugs and OTC drugs, for example. The following descriptions are as accurate as possible but do not cover all the potential variation among field contents.

This page groups fields conceptually for ease of reference. In API results, fields will be ordered naturally as in the product labeling submission.

There are records with fields that are not documented here and that are not ordinarily part of human drug product labeling, such as `veterinary_indications`. This is usually the result of a data error in the SPL submission.

### ID and version

All drug product labeling records contain these fields, which uniquely identify individual records.

This field may be ommitted if the drug is not absorbed systemically and the drug is not known to have a potential for indirect harm to the fetus. It may contain information about the established pregnancy category classification for the drug. (That information is nominally listed in the `teratogenic_effects` field, but may be listed here instead.)

`teratogenic_effects`

: *Pregnancy category C:* Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, and the benefits from the use of the drug in pregnant women may be acceptable despite its potential risks.
: *Pregnancy category D:* There is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans, but the potential benefits from the use of the drug in pregnant women may be acceptable despite its potential risks (for example, if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or serious disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective).
: *Pregnancy category X:* Studies in animals or humans have demonstrated fetal abnormalities or there is positive evidence of fetal risk based on adverse reaction reports from investigational or marketing experience, or both, and the risk of the use of the drug in a pregnant woman clearly outweighs any possible benefit (for example, safer drugs or other forms of therapy are available).

### openFDA fields

`openfda`
: **dictionary**
: For all fields in the `openfda` section, see the [API basics]({{ site.baseurl }}/api/reference/#openfda-fields).

Different datasets use different drug identifiers—brand name, generic name, NDA, NDC, etc. It can be difficult to find the same drug in different datasets. And some identifiers, like pharmacologic class, are useful search filters but not available in all datasets.

OpenFDA features harmonization of drug identifiers, to make it easier to search drug product labeling by these identifiers, like product type (OTC versus prescription). **The `openfda` section in the result is an annotation with this information.**

The vast majority (about 98%) of drug product labeling records have an `openfda` section.
