OpenFDA is an exciting new initiative in the [Food and Drug Administration’s](http://www.fda.gov/) Office of Informatics and Technology Innovation (OITI) spearheaded by FDA’s [Chief Health Informatics Officer (CHIO), Dr. Taha Kass-Hout, MD, MS.](http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/ucm349836.htm) OpenFDA offers easy access to FDA public data and highlights projects using these data in both the public and private sector to further regulatory or scientific missions, educate the public, and save lives.

## What does it do?

OpenFDA provides APIs and raw download access to a number of high-value structured datasets, including adverse events and recall enforcement reports. The platform is currently in public beta.

In the future, openFDA will provide a platform for public challenges issued by the FDA and a place for the community to interact with each other and FDA domain experts with the goal of spurring innovation around FDA data.

We're currently focused on working on datasets in the following areas:

- **Adverse Events**: FDA’s publically available drug adverse event reports, a database that contains millions of adverse event and medication error reports submitted to FDA covering all regulated drugs.
- **Recalls**: Enforcement report data, containing information gathered from public notices about certain recalls of FDA-regulated products.
- **Documentation** *(coming soon)*: Structured Product Labeling Data, containing detailed product label information on many FDA-regulated products

We'll be releasing a number of updates and additional datasets throughout the upcoming months.
