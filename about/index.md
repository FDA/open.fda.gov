OpenFDA is the first innovation created by [Taha Kass-Hout, MD, MS](http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/ucm349836.htm), upon joining [FDA](http://www.fda.gov/) as the first Chief Health Information Officer in March 2013. The goal of the project is to create easy access to public data, to create a new level of openness and accountability, to ensure the privacy and security of public FDA data, and ultimately to educate the public and save lives. The concept was to index high-value public-access data, format and document that data in developer and consumer-friendly standards, and make that data available via a public-access portal that enables developers to quickly and easily use it in applications. Dr. Kass-Hout launched the project by obtaining a Presidential Innovation Fellow to focus on policy and programmatic issues in July 2013. In August 2013, a research and development contract was awarded to [Iodine, Inc.](http://www.iodine.com/) {% include external-link.html %} to build the site under BAA contract number HHSF223201400128C. The public cloud environment was determined in September 2013, and Dr. Kass-Hout's team solicited agency and user input into policies, first priority datasets, and desirable technical characteristics of openFDA. In December 2013 FDA established the Office of Informatics and Technology Innovation (OITI) under Dr. Kass-Hout’s leadership. All the project milestones were met despite the government shutdown.

OpenFDA launched in Beta mode on June 2, 2014, at [https://open.fda.gov](https://open.fda.gov). It features an open user community for sharing open source code, examples, and ideas. By September 2014, medical device reports, enforcement reports, and drug adverse event reports were available, and every mention of a drug in those reports was automatically augmented with full data from various drug datasets, including codes and label information. In addition, there were over 4.5 million data calls, over 40,000 visitors to openFDA from all over the world, dozens of press articles, and several websites that use openFDA in their own public offerings.

During Fiscal Year 2015, additional datasets and harmonization will be added.

## What does it do?

OpenFDA provides APIs and is investigating raw download access to a number of high-value structured datasets, including adverse events, drug product labeling, and recall enforcement reports. The platform is currently in public beta.

In the future, openFDA will provide a platform for public challenges issued by the FDA and a place for the community to interact with each other and FDA domain experts with the goal of spurring innovation around FDA data.

We're currently focused on datasets in the following areas:

- **Adverse events.** FDA’s publically available drug adverse event and medication error reports, and medical device adverse event reports.
- **Recalls.** Enforcement report data, containing information gathered from public notices about certain recalls of FDA-regulated products.
- **Labeling.** Structured Product Labeling (SPL) data for FDA-regulated human prescription drug, OTC drug and biological product labeling.
