countBySpecies:
  params:
    - count the number of records of each species.
  query: 'https://openfda-api.preprod.fda.gov/animalandveterinary/phishpharm.json?count=species.exact'
  description:
    - This query returns a count of records for each species.
    - The suffix .exact is required by openFDA to count the unique full phrases in the field openfda.product_type. Without it, the API will count each word in that field individuallyâ€”Trout, rainbow would be counted as separate values, Trout, and rainbow.
