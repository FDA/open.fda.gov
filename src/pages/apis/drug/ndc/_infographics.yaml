  short: "Enforcement reports over time"
  description:
    - "This is the openFDA API endpoint for all drug product recalls monitored by the FDA. When an FDA-regulated product is either defective or potentially harmful, recalling that product—removing it from the market or correcting the problem—is the most effective means for protecting the public."
    - "Recalls are almost always voluntary, meaning a company discovers a problem and recalls a product on its own. Other times a company recalls a product after FDA raises concerns. Only in rare cases will FDA request or order a recall. But in every case, FDA's role is to oversee a company's strategy, classify the recalled products according to the level of hazard involved, and assess the adequacy of the recall. Recall information is posted in the Enforcement Reports once the products are classified."
    - "Only about half of the enforcement reports in the API have an openfda section with information about whether the drug product involved was an over-the-counter or prescription product."

  short: "Seriousness"
  description:
    - "Recalls are classified into three categories: Class I, a dangerous or defective product that predictably could cause serious health problems or death, Class II, meaning that the product might cause a temporary health problem, or pose only a slight threat of a serious nature, and Class III, a product that is unlikely to cause any adverse health reaction, but that violates FDA labeling or manufacturing laws."
    - "Note that only about half of the enforcement reports in the API have an openfda section with information about whether the drug product involved was an over-the-counter or prescription product."
