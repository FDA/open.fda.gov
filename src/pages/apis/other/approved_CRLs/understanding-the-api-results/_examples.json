Because of this limited information, the dosing for patients with\nsevere renal impairment cannot be supported by available data. To inform dosing for patients\nwith severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease, we recommend that you conduct a\npharmacokinetic study following a single dose of amisulpride in patients with severe renal\nimpairment and end-stage renal disease (i.e., eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m7), and healthy subjects\nas a control group.\n\nOTHER\n\nWithin one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions\navailable under 21 CFR 314.110. If you do not take one of these actions, we may consider your\nlack of response a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65. You may also\nrequest an extension of time in which to resubmit the application.\n\nA resubmission must fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter and should be clearly\nmarked with \"RESUBMISSION\" in large font, bolded type at the beginning of the cover letter\nof the submission. The cover letter should clearly state that you consider this resubmission a\ncomplete response to the deficiencies outlined in this letter. A partial response to this letter will\nnot be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new review cycle.\n\nYou may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss what steps you need to take\nbefore the application may be approved. If you wish to have such a meeting, submit your\nmeeting request as described in the draft FDA Guidance for Industry, “Formal Meetings\nBetween the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products,” December 2017 at\nhttps://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM59054\n7.\n\nReference ID: 4331444\n\nNDA 209510\nPage 4\n\nThe drug product may not be legally marketed until you have been notified in writing that this\napplication is approved.\n\nIf you have any questions, call CAPT Mimi Phan, Regulatory Project Manager, at (301) 796-\n5408.\n\nSincerely,\n\n{See appended electronic signature page}\n\nVictor Crentsil, M.D., M.H.S.\n\nActing Deputy Director\n\nOffice of Drug Evaluation III\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nENCLOSURES:\nPrescribing Information Labeling\nContainer and Carton Labeling\n\n16 Page(s) of Draft Labeling have been Withheld in Full as B4 (CCI/TS) immediately\nfollowing this page\n\nReference ID: 4331444\n\nSignature Page 1 of 1\n\nThis is a representation of an electronic record that was signed\nelectronically.
