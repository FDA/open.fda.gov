    - 'Each endpoint has its own unique fields, particular to the kind of data that it serves.'

searchSingleTerm:
  title: Matching a single search term
  description:
    - 'This query looks in the `drug/event` endpoint for a record where one of the reported patient reactions was fatigue.'

searchAll:
  title: Matching all search terms
  description:
    - 'This query looks in the `drug/event` endpoint for a record where **both** fatigue was a reported patient reaction **and** the country in which the event happened was Canada. The key here is the `+AND+` that joins the two search terms.'

count:
  title: Counting records where certain terms occur
  description:
    - 'This query looks in the `drug/event` endpoint for all records. It then returns a count of the top patient reactions. For each reaction, the number of records that matched is summed, providing a useful summary.'
  params:
    - 'Search for all records'
    - 'Count the number of records matching the terms in `patient.reaction.reactionmeddrapt.exact`. The `.exact` suffix here tells the API to count whole phrases (e.g. **injection site reaction**) instead of individual words (e.g. **injection**, **site**, and **reaction** separately)'
  query: 'https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?count=patient.reaction.reactionmeddrapt.exact'
missing:
  title: Data is missing from a field
  description:
    - 'This query looks in the `drug/event` endpoint for records that are missing a company number, meaning that the report was submitted directly by a member of the public and not through a drug manufacturer.'
