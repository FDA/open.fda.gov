reaction:
  title: Count of consumer reactions
  description:
    - This query is similar to the prior one, but returns a count of the 1000 most frequently reported consumer reactions.
    - count the field reaction.exact (consumer reactions).
    - The suffix .exact is required by openFDA to count the unique full phrases in the field reactions. Without it, the API will count each word in that field individually—difficulty sleeping would be counted as separate values, difficulty and sleeping.
    - See the [reaction reference](/food/event/reference/) for more about consumer reactions in adverse event records.
  params:
    - search for all records where products.industry_code (FDA industry code) contains 23 (cereal prep/breakfast food).
