  title: One drug adverse event report
  description:
    - 'This query searches in the `drug/event` endpoint for a single record, and returns it. The record contains all kinds of information about the adverse event report, including the drugs that the patient was taking, the reactions that the patient experienced, and a good deal of other context.'
    - 'Each endpoint has its own unique fields, particular to the kind of data that it serves.'

searchAll:
  title: Matching all search terms
  description:
    - 'This query looks in the `drug/event` endpoint for a record where **both** fatigue was a reported patient reaction **and** the country in which the event happened was Canada. The key here is the `+AND+` that joins the two search terms.'

count:
  title: Counting records where certain terms occur
  description:
    - 'This query looks in the `drug/event` endpoint for all records. It then returns a count of the top patient reactions. For each reaction, the number of records that matched is summed, providing a useful summary.'
  params:
    - 'Search for all records'
    - 'Count the number of records matching the terms in `patient.reaction.reactionmeddrapt.exact`. The `.exact` suffix here tells the API to count whole phrases (e.g. **injection site reaction**) instead of individual words (e.g. **injection**, **site**, and **reaction** separately)'

missing:
  title: Data is missing from a field
  description:
    - 'This query looks in the `drug/event` endpoint for records that are missing a company number, meaning that the report was submitted directly by a member of the public and not through a drug manufacturer.'
  params:
    - 'Search for records where the field `companynumb` is missing or empty'
  query: 'https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?search=_missing_:companynumb&limit=1'
