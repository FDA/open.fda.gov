  - "### Key facts":
    - ul:
      - "**Source of the data:** [FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)](/data/faers/)"
      - "**Changes to the source data:** OpenFDA annotates the original records with [special fields](#openfda-fields) and converts the data into JSON, which is a widely used machine readable format."
      - "**What time period is covered in this API:** Currently, this API includes publically releasable records submitted to the FDA through FAERS since 2004"
      - "**How often is the data in this API updated:** Quarterly. However, please be advised that the data in this API may lag by 3 months or more at any given time, depending on when the quarterly FAERS data is released."

  - "#### About FAERS data":
    - "An adverse event is submitted to the FDA to report any undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product in a patient. For drugs, this includes serious drug side effects, product use errors, product quality problems, and therapeutic failures for prescription or over-the-counter medicines and medicines administered to hospital patients or at outpatient infusion centers."
    - "Reporting of adverse events by healthcare professionals and consumers is voluntary in the United States. FDA receives some adverse event reports directly from healthcare professionals (such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses and others) and consumers (such as patients, family members, lawyers and others). Healthcare professionals and consumers may also report adverse events to the products’ manufacturers. If a manufacturer receives an adverse event report, it is normally required to send the report to FDA."

  - "#### How adverse event reports are collected":
    - "Adverse events are collected through a series of **safety reports**. Each is identified by a 8-digit string (for instance, `6176304-1`). The first 7 digits (before the hyphen) identify the individual report, and the last digit (after the hyphen) is a checksum. Rather than updating individual records in FAERS, subsequent updates are submitted in seperate reports."

  - "#### How adverse events are formatted and organized":
    - "Adverse event reports use the [ICH E2b/M2 version 2.1 standard.](http://estri.ich.org/e2br22/ICH_ICSR_Specification_V2-3.pdf)"
    - "This highly simplified schematic illustrates the general nature of an adverse event report. A report may list several drug products, as well as several patient reactions. No individual drug is connected to any individual reaction. **When a report lists multiple drugs and multiple reactions, there is no way to conclude from the data therein that a given drug is responsible for a given reaction.**"
    - "multipleProductTable"
    - "Any number of the drugs may be marked as *suspect* if thought to be responsible for one or more of the reactions, but that information is not validated. *Concomitant* drugs are those which are not suspected of causing one or more of the reactions. Many drug products appear frequently in adverse event reports simply because they are commonly taken by many people in the population, not because they are responsible for more adverse events."
    - "Reports contain varying levels of detail about the drug products involved, indications for use, route of administration, and dose."
    - "[infographic here]"

  - "### Responsible use of the data":
    - "Adverse event reports submitted to FDA do not undergo extensive validation or verification. Therefore, **a causal relationship cannot be established between product and reactions listed in a report.** While a suspected relationship *may* exist, it is not medically validated and should not be the sole source of information for clinical decision making or other assumptions about the safety or efficacy of a product."
    - "Additionally, it is important to remember that adverse event reports represent a small percentage of total usage numbers of a product. Common products may have a higher number of adverse events due to the higher total number of people using the product. In recent years the FDA has undertaken efforts to increase collection of adverse events. Increases in the total number of adverse events is likely caused by improved reporting."

  - "### Disclaimer":
    - "FAERS data does have limitations. There is no certainty that the reported event (adverse event or medication error) was actually due to the product. FDA does not require that a causal relationship between a product and event be proven, and reports do not always contain enough detail to properly evaluate an event."
    - "Further, FDA does not receive reports for every adverse event or medication error that occurs with a product. Many factors can influence whether or not an event will be reported, such as the time a product has been marketed and publicity about an event."
    - "Submission of a safety report does not constitute an admission that medical personnel, user facility, importer, distributor, manufacturer or product caused or contributed to the event. The information in these reports has not been scientifically or otherwise verified as to a cause and effect relationship and cannot be used to estimate the incidence of these events."

- "## How to use the API":
  - "Getting started with and learning how to use the API is relatively straightforward. Here are some recommended steps:"
  - "*1.* If you haven’t already, [read the API Basics page](/getting_started/api_basics/)."
  - "*2.* Review the [list of searchable fields](#searchable-fields) available in the drug adverse event dataset."
  - "*3.* Try out the Drug Adverse Event API using the [interactive examples](#using-the-interactive-chart-to-learn-the-API) and tools below."
  - "Then, when you are ready, obtain an API Key. While you don’t need an API Key to try or use the API, we recommend you get one if you are planning to use the API on a regular basis. For more information on API Keys, see the [API Reference page](/getting_started/api_basics/reference/)."

  - "### Making a simple API call":
    - "You can call the API from a web browser. Simply type a valid API query in your browser’s address bar and press the Enter key."
    - "In the example below, we are searching the records in the drug adverse events endpoint for matches with 'headache' in the 'reactionmeddrapt' field. We are requesting to see the first 5 records that match."
    - "image=/img/drug_event_query.png"

  - "#### Some key pointers":
    - ul:
      - "An openFDA API query always begins with the base endpoint, which in this case is: https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json"
      - "Searches have a special syntax: `search=field:term`."
      - "Unless otherwise specified, the API will return only one matching record for a search. You can specify the number of records to be returned by using the limit parameter. The maximum limit allowed is 99 for any single API call. If no limit is set, the API will return one matching record."

  - "#### Some advanced topics":
    - "It is possible to construct very complex queries using the openFDA API. See the [API Basics page](/getting_started/api_basics/) to learn more about all the available query parameters, how to handle quotations, spaces, phrase matches, and groupings, how to search on dates and ranges, and more."
    - "Here are a few additional tips just to get you started"
    - ul:
      - "`search=field:term+AND+field:term`: Search for records that match both terms"
      - "`search=field:term+field:term`: Search for records that match either of the two terms"
      - "`count=field`: Use the count parameter to count how often a term appears in the dataset"
      - "`search=field:term&count=another_field`: Search for matching records. Then within that set of records, count the number of times that the unique values of a field appear. Instead of looking at individual records, you can use the [count] parameter to count how often certain terms (like drug names or patient reactions) appear in the matching set of records."

  - "### Example API Queries":
    - "To help get you started, we have provided some API query examples below. Use the Run query button to call the API and get back results. You can experiment by editing the example queries in the black text box."
    - queryExplorer: oneReport
    - queryExplorer: pharmacologic
    - queryExplorer: reaction

  - "### Explore the API with an interactive chart":
    - "Use the interactive chart below to explore the dataset and to learn how you can construct different API queries."

  - "### Understanding the API Results":
    - "For `search` queries (such as: [https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?search=receivedate:[20040101+TO+20081231]&limit=1](https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?search=receivedate:[20040101+TO+20081231]&limit=1)), the `results` section includes matching adverse event reports returned by the API."
    - "Each adverse event report consists of these major sections:"
    - ul:
      - "**Header:** General information about the adverse event"
      - "**Patient Information:** Details on the patient who experienced the event, such as age, weight, sex, etc."
      - "**Drugs:** Information on the drugs taken while the event was experienced"
      - "**Reactions:** Information on the reactions experienced by the patient"
    - "The order of these fields in the results can and will vary..."
    - "For count queries (such as: [https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?search=patient.drug.openfda.pharm_class_epc:'nonsteroidal+antiinflammatory+drug'&count=patient.reaction.reactionmeddrapt.exact](https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?search=patient.drug.openfda.pharm_class_epc:'nonsteroidal+antiinflammatory+drug'&count=patient.reaction.reactionmeddrapt.exact)), the results section will look something like the following:"
