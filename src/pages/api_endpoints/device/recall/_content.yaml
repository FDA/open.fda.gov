- "## About device recalls"
- "A recall is an action taken to address a problem with a medical device that violates FDA law. Recalls occur when a medical device is defective, when it could be a risk to health, or when it is both defective and a risk to health. Recall as defined in 21 CFR 7.3(g) is “a firm’s removal or correction of a marketed product that the Food and Drug Administration considers to be in violation of the laws it administers and against which the agency would initiate legal action, e.g., seizure. Recall does not include a market withdrawal or a stock recovery.” If a firm conducts a recall to reduce a risk to health, the firm is required to submit a written report to the FDA with the information described in 21 CFR 806.10."
