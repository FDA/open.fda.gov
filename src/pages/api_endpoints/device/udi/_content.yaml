- "## Overview":
  - "The openFDA unique device identifier API returns data from the Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID), which contains information submitted to the FDA about medical devices that have Unique Device Identifiers (UDI)."
  - "UDIs are unique numeric or alphanumeric codes that consist of two parts—a device identifier (DI) and a production identifier (PI). UDIs are intended to increase electronic tracking abilities for devices involved in adverse events. Submission to the GUDID database is required for manufacturers of medical devices. The FDA is establishing the unique device identification system to adequately identify devices sold in the U.S.- from manufacturing through distribution to patient use."
  - "To learn more about UDIs, see the [FDA's General information about UDI page](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/UniqueDeviceIdentification/default.htm)."

  - "### Responsible use of the data":
    - "Do not rely on openFDA to make decisions regarding medical care. Always speak to your health provider about the risks and benefits of FDA-regulated products. We may limit or otherwise restrict your access to the API in line with our [Terms of Service](http://open.fda.gov-website-redesign.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/terms/)"

- "## How to use the API":
  - "Getting started with and learning how to use the API is relatively straightforward. Here are some recommended steps:"
  - "*1.* If you haven’t already, [read the API Basics page](/getting_started/api_basics/)."
  - "*2.* Review the [list of searchable fields](#searchable-fields) for this dataset."
  - "*3.* Try out the Device UDI API using the [interactive examples](#using-the-interactive-chart-to-learn-the-API) and tools below."
  - "Then, when you are ready, obtain an API Key. While you don’t need an API Key to try or use the API, we recommend you get one if you are planning to use the API on a regular basis. For more information on API Keys, see the [API Reference page](/getting_started/api_basics/reference/)."

  - "### Making a simple API call":
    - "You can call the API from a web browser. Simply type a valid API query in your browser’s address bar and press the Enter key."
    - "In the example below, we are searching the records in the drug adverse events endpoint for matches with 'true' in the 'is_combination_product' field. We are requesting to see the first 5 records that match."

  - "#### Some key pointers":
    - ul:
      - "An openFDA API query always begins with the base endpoint, which in this case is: https://api.fda.gov/device/udi.json"
      - "Searches have a special syntax: `search=field:term`."
      - "Unless otherwise specified, the API will return only one matching record for a search. You can specify the number of records to be returned by using the limit parameter. The maximum limit allowed is 99 for any single API call. If no limit is set, the API will return one matching record."

  - "#### Some advanced topics":
    - "It is possible to construct very complex queries using the openFDA API. See the [API Basics page](/getting_started/api_basics/) to learn more about all the available query parameters, how to handle quotations, spaces, phrase matches, and groupings, how to search on dates and ranges, and more."
    - "Here are a few additional tips just to get you started"
    - ul:
      - "`search=field:term+AND+field:term`: Search for records that match both terms"
      - "`search=field:term+field:term`: Search for records that match either of the two terms"
      - "`count=field`: Use the count parameter to count how often a term appears in the dataset"
      - "`search=field:term&count=another_field`: Search for matching records. Then within that set of records, count the number of times that the unique values of a field appear. Instead of looking at individual records, you can use the [count] parameter to count how often certain terms (like drug names or patient reactions) appear in the matching set of records."

  - "### Example API Queries":
    - "To help get you started, we have provided some API query examples below. Use the Run query button to call the API and get back results. You can experiment by editing the example queries in the black text box."

  - "### Explore the API with an interactive chart":
    - "Use the interactive chart below to explore the dataset and to learn how you can construct different API queries."

  - "### Understanding the API Results":
    - 'For `search` queries (such as: [https://api.fda.gov/device/udi.json?search=is_rx:true](https://api.fda.gov/device/udi.json?search=is_rx:true), the `results` section includes matching device classification records returned by the API.'
    - example: anatomy
    - "For count queries (such as: [https://api.fda.gov/device/udi.json?count=device_class](https://api.fda.gov/device/udi.json?count=device_class)), the results section will look something like the following:"
