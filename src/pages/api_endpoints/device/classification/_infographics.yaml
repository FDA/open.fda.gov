- title: "Device classifications by medical specialty"
  short: "By medical specialty"
  description:
    - "Most medical devices can be classified by finding the matching description of the device in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 862-892."
    - "FDA has classified and described over 1,700 distinct types of devices and organized them in the CFR into 16 medical specialty `panels` such as `Cardiovascular` devices or `Ear, Nose, and Throat` devices. These panels are found in Parts 862 through 892 in the CFR. For each of the devices classified by the FDA the CFR gives a general description including the intended use, the class to which the device belongs (i.e., Class I, II, or III), and information about marketing requirements. Your device should meet the definition in a classification regulation contained in 21 CFR 862-892."
