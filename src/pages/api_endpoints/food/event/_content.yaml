- "## About food, dietary supplement, and cosmetic adverse events"
- "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates food products in the United States, working to assure that the food supply is safe, sanitary, wholesome, and honestly labeled. FDA's responsibility covers all domestic and imported food except meat, poultry, and frozen, dried, and liquid eggs, and the labeling of alcoholic beverages (above 7% alcohol). It even includes dietary supplements, bottled water, food additives, infant formulas, and other food products. The FDA also regulates all cosmetic products and ingredients in the United States, including hair products, makeup, soaps, and lotions."
- "An adverse event is submitted to the FDA to report adverse health effects and product complaints about foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. These may include side effects, product use errors, and product quality problems. Reporting is voluntary for beverages, conventional foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics, which means that manufacturers and citizens may report them at any time but are not obligated to. For dietary supplements, manufacturers, packers, and distributers must notify the FDA if they receive reports about serious adverse events in connection with the use of their products."
- "### Adverse event reports"
- "Even with mandatory reporting of serious adverse events for dietary supplements, generally only a small fraction of adverse events associated with any product is reported."
- "A report may list several products, as well as several reactions that the consumer experienced. No individual food, dietary supplements, or cosmetic product is connected to any individual reaction. When a report lists multiple products and multiple reactions, there is no way to conclude from the data therein that a given product is responsible for a given reaction."
- "Reports to FDA do not necessarily include all relevant data, such as whether an individual also suffered from other medical conditions (such as cardiac disease) or took other supplements or medication at the same time. They also may not include accurate or complete contact information for FDA to seek further information about the event, or complainants may choose not to participate in the follow-up investigation."
- "When important information is missing from a report, it is difficult for FDA to fully evaluate whether the product caused the adverse event or simply coincided with it. The fact that an adverse event happened after a person took a dietary supplement does not necessarily mean that the dietary supplement caused the adverse event."
- "### How to search this endpoint"
- "Make API calls to `https://api.fda.gov/food/event.json` using search parameters for fields specific to the food adverse events endpoint."
- queryExplorer: oneReport
- queryExplorer: industry

- "## Data reference"
- "The openFDA food, dietary supplements, and cosmetic adverse event API returns data from the [Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS)](/data/caers/), a database that contains information on adverse event and product complaint reports submitted to FDA for foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. The database is designed to support CFSAN's safety surveillance program."
- "For more information about the CAERS data, please see this web page:  [http://www.fda.gov/Food/ComplianceEnforcement/ucm494015.htm](http://www.fda.gov/Food/ComplianceEnforcement/ucm494015.htm)."
- "### How adverse events are organized"
- "Each report received regarding an individual that experiences an adverse event is assigned a unique report number."
- "### Downloads"
- "downloads"
- "## Anatomy of a response"
- "This is a simulated openFDA API return for a non-`count` query. It is divided into two high-level sections, `meta` and `results`."
- example: anatomy
- "### Meta"
- "For non-`count` queries, the `meta` section includes a disclaimer, a link to the openFDA data license, and information about the results that follow."
- example: meta
- fields:
  - meta.disclaimer
  - meta.license
  - meta.last_updated
  - meta.results.skip
  - meta.results.limit
  - meta.results.total
- "### Results"
- "For non-`count` queries, the `results` section includes matching adverse event reports returned by the API."
- "Each adverse event report consists of these major sections:"
- ul:
  - "Header: General information about the adverse event report"
  - "Consumer: Information about the individual who experienced the adverse event"
  - "Products: Information about the products involved in the adverse event report"
  - "Reactions: Information on the reactions or symptoms experienced by the individual involved"
  - "Outcomes: Information on known outcomes or consequences of the adverse event"
