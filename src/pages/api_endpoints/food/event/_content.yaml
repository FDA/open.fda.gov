- "## Overview":
  - "The openFDA food, dietary supplements, and cosmetic adverse event API returns data from the [Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS)](/data/caers/), a database that contains information on adverse event and product complaint reports submitted to FDA for foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. The database is designed to support CFSAN's safety surveillance program."

  - "#### Key facts":
    - ul:
      - "**Source of the data:** [Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS)](/data/caers/)"
      - "**Changes to the source data:** OpenFDA annotates the original records with [special fields](#openfda-fields) and converts the data into JSON, which is a widely used machine readable format."
      - "**What time period is covered in this API:** 2004 to present"
      - "**How often is the data in this API updated:** Quarterly."
      - "**Date last updated:** 11/17/2007"

  - "#### Additional Information About Food, Dietary Supplement, and Cosmetic Adverse Events":
    - "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates food products in the United States, working to assure that the food supply is safe, sanitary, wholesome, and honestly labeled. FDA's responsibility covers all domestic and imported food except meat, poultry, and frozen, dried, and liquid eggs, and the labeling of alcoholic beverages (above 7% alcohol). It even includes dietary supplements, bottled water, food additives, infant formulas, and other food products. The FDA also regulates all cosmetic products and ingredients in the United States, including hair products, makeup, soaps, and lotions."
    - "Reporting of adverse events by healthcare professionals and consumers is voluntary in the United States. FDA receives some adverse event reports directly from healthcare professionals (such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses and others) and consumers (such as patients, family members, lawyers and others). Healthcare professionals and consumers may also report adverse events to the products’ manufacturers. If a manufacturer receives an adverse event report, it is normally required to send the report to FDA."
    - "An adverse event is submitted to the FDA to report adverse health effects and product complaints about foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. These may include side effects, product use errors, and product quality problems. Reporting is voluntary for beverages, conventional foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics, which means that manufacturers and citizens may report them at any time but are not obligated to. For dietary supplements, manufacturers, packers, and distributers must notify the FDA if they receive reports about serious adverse events in connection with the use of their products."
    - "Each report received regarding an individual that experiences an adverse event is assigned a unique report number. Even with mandatory reporting of serious adverse events for dietary supplements, generally only a small fraction of adverse events associated with any product is reported."
    - "A report may list several products, as well as several reactions that the consumer experienced. No individual food, dietary supplements, or cosmetic product is connected to any individual reaction. When a report lists multiple products and multiple reactions, there is no way to conclude from the data therein that a given product is responsible for a given reaction."

    - ul:
      - "[CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS)](http://www.fda.gov/Food/ComplianceEnforcement/ucm494015.htm)"

  - "### Responsible use of the data":
    - "Adverse event reports submitted to FDA do not undergo extensive validation or verification. Therefore, **a causal relationship cannot be established between product and reactions listed in a report.** While a suspected relationship *may* exist, it is not medically validated and should not be the sole source of information for clinical decision making or other assumptions about the safety or efficacy of a product."
    - "Additionally, it is important to remember that adverse event reports represent a small percentage of total usage numbers of a product. Common products may have a higher number of adverse events due to the higher total number of people using the product. In recent years the FDA has undertaken efforts to increase collection of adverse events. Increases in the total number of adverse events is likely caused by improved reporting."

  - "### Disclaimer":
    - "FAERS data does have limitations. There is no certainty that the reported event (adverse event or medication error) was actually due to the product. FDA does not require that a causal relationship between a product and event be proven, and reports do not always contain enough detail to properly evaluate an event."
    - "Further, FDA does not receive reports for every adverse event or medication error that occurs with a product. Many factors can influence whether or not an event will be reported, such as the time a product has been marketed and publicity about an event."
    - "Submission of a safety report does not constitute an admission that medical personnel, user facility, importer, distributor, manufacturer or product caused or contributed to the event. The information in these reports has not been scientifically or otherwise verified as to a cause and effect relationship and cannot be used to estimate the incidence of these events."

- "## How to use the API":
  - "Getting started with and learning how to use the API is relatively straightforward. Here are some recommended steps:"
  - "*1.* If you haven’t already, [read the API Basics page](/getting_started/api_basics/)."
  - "*2.* Review the [list of searchable fields](#searchable-fields) available in the food adverse event dataset."
  - "*3.* Try out the Food Adverse Event API using the [interactive examples](#using-the-interactive-chart-to-learn-the-API) and tools below."
  - "Then, when you are ready, obtain an API Key. While you don’t need an API Key to try or use the API, we recommend you get one if you are planning to use the API on a regular basis. For more information on API Keys, see the [API Reference page](/getting_started/api_basics/reference/)."

  - "### Making a simple API call":
    - "You can call the API from a web browser. Simply type a valid API query in your browser’s address bar and press the Enter key."
    - "In the example below, we are searching the records in the drug adverse events endpoint for matches with 'Snack Food Item' in the 'industry_name' field. We are requesting to see the first 5 records that match."
    - "image=/img/food_event_query.png"

  - "#### Some key pointers":
    - ul:
      - "An openFDA API query always begins with the base endpoint, which in this case is: https://api.fda.gov/food/event.json"
      - "Searches have a special syntax: `search=field:term`."
      - "Unless otherwise specified, the API will return only one matching record for a search. You can specify the number of records to be returned by using the limit parameter. The maximum limit allowed is 99 for any single API call. If no limit is set, the API will return one matching record."

  - "#### Some advanced topics":
    - "It is possible to construct very complex queries using the openFDA API. See the [API Basics page](/getting_started/api_basics/) to learn more about all the available query parameters, how to handle quotations, spaces, phrase matches, and groupings, how to search on dates and ranges, and more."
    - "Here are a few additional tips just to get you started"
    - ul:
      - "`search=field:term+AND+field:term`: Search for records that match both terms"
      - "`search=field:term+field:term`: Search for records that match either of the two terms"
      - "`count=field`: Use the count parameter to count how often a term appears in the dataset"
      - "`search=field:term&count=another_field`: Search for matching records. Then within that set of records, count the number of times that the unique values of a field appear. Instead of looking at individual records, you can use the [count] parameter to count how often certain terms (like drug names or patient reactions) appear in the matching set of records."

  - "### Example API Queries":
    - "To help get you started, we have provided some API query examples below. Use the Run query button to call the API and get back results. You can experiment by editing the example queries in the black text box."
    - queryExplorer: oneReport
    - queryExplorer: industry
    - queryExplorer: reaction

  - "### Explore the API with an interactive chart":
    - "Use the interactive chart below to explore the dataset and to learn how you can construct different API queries."

  - "### Understanding the API Results":
    - 'For `search` queries (such as: [https://api.fda.gov/food/event.json?search=outcomes:"serious+injuries"](https://api.fda.gov/food/event.json?search=outcomes:"serious+injuries"), the `results` section includes matching adverse event reports returned by the API.'
    - "Each adverse event report consists of these major sections:"
    - ul:
      - "**Header:** General information about the adverse event"
      - "**Consumer:** Information about the individual who experienced the adverse event"
      - "**Products:** Information about the products involved in the adverse event report"
      - "**Reactions:** Information on the reactions or symptoms experienced by the individual involved"
      - "**Outcomes:** Information on known outcomes or consequences of the adverse event"
    - "For count queries (such as: [https://api.fda.gov/food/event.json?count=reactions.exact](https://api.fda.gov/food/event.json?count=reactions.exact)), the results section will look something like the following:"
