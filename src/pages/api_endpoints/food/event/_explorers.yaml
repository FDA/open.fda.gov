reaction:
  title: Count of consumer reactions
  description:
    - This query is similar to the prior one, but returns a count of the 1000 most frequently reported consumer reactions.
    - count the field reaction.exact (consumer reactions).
    - The suffix .exact is required by openFDA to count the unique full phrases in the field reactions. Without it, the API will count each word in that field individuallyâ€”difficulty sleeping would be counted as separate values, difficulty and sleeping.

  params:
    - search for all records where products.industry_code (FDA industry code) contains 23 (cereal prep/breakfast food).
