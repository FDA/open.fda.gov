- "## Overview":
  - "This is the openFDA API endpoint for all food product recalls monitored by the FDA. The openFDA food enforcement reports API returns data from the [FDA Recall Enterprise System (RES)](/data/res/), a database that contains information on recall event information submitted to FDA. Currently, this data covers publically releasable records from 2004-present. The data is updated weekly."

  - "#### Key facts":
    - ul:
      - "**Source of the data:** [FDA Recall Enterprise System (RES)](/data/res/)"
      - "**Changes to the source data:** OpenFDA annotates the original records with [special fields](#openfda-fields) and converts the data into JSON, which is a widely used machine readable format."
      - "**What time period is covered in this API:** 2004 to present"
      - "**How often is the data in this API updated:** Weekly."
      - "**Date last updated:** 11/17/2007"

  - "#### Additional Information About Food Recalls and Enforcement Reports":
    - "When an FDA-regulated product is either defective or potentially harmful, recalling that product—removing it from the market or correcting the problem—is the most effective means for protecting the public."
    - "Recalls are almost always voluntary, meaning a company discovers a problem and recalls a product on its own. Other times a company recalls a product after FDA raises concerns. Only in rare cases will FDA request or order a recall. But in every case, FDA's role is to oversee a company's strategy, classify the recalled products according to the level of hazard involved, and assess the adequacy of the recall. Recall information is posted in the Enforcement Reports once the products are classified."
    - "An enforcement report contains information on actions taken in connection with FDA regulatory activities."
    - "Whereas not all recalls are announced in the media or on our recall press release page all FDA-monitored recalls go into FDA’s Enforcement Report once they are classified according to the level of hazard involved. For more information, see [FDA 101: Product Recalls from First Alert to Effectiveness Checks](https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm049070.htm)."

  - "### Responsible use of the data":
    - "Do not rely on openFDA to make decisions regarding medical care. Always speak to your health provider about the risks and benefits of FDA-regulated products. We may limit or otherwise restrict your access to the API in line with our [Terms of Service](http://open.fda.gov-website-redesign.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/terms/)"

  - "### Disclaimer":
    - "This data should not be used as a method to collect data to issue alerts to the public, nor should it be used to track the lifecycle of a recall. FDA seeks publicity about a recall only when it believes the public needs to be alerted to a serious hazard. FDA works with industry and our state partners to publish press releases and other public notices about recalls that may potentially present a significant or serious risk to the consumer or user of the product. Subscribe to this [Recall/Safety Alert feed here](http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ContactFDA/StayInformed/RSSFeeds/Recalls/rss.xml)."
    - "Further, FDA does not update the status of a recall after the recall has been classified according to its level of hazard. As such, the status of a recall (open, completed, or terminated) will remain unchanged after published in the Enforcement Reports."
    - "When necessary, the FDA will make corrections or changes to recall information previously disclosed in a past Enforcement Report for various reasons. For instance, the firm may discover that the initial recall should be expanded to include more batches or lots of the same recalled product than formerly reported. For more information about corrections or changes implemented, please refer to the [Enforcement Report’s Changes to Past Enforcement Reports page](http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/EnforcementReports/ucm345487.htm)."

- "## How to use the API":
  - "Getting started with and learning how to use the API is relatively straightforward. Here are some recommended steps:"
  - "*1.* If you haven’t already, [read the API Basics page](/getting_started/api_basics/)."
  - "*2.* Review the [list of searchable fields](#searchable-fields) for this dataset."
  - "*3.* Try out the Food Enforcement Report API using the [interactive examples](#using-the-interactive-chart-to-learn-the-API) and tools below."
  - "Then, when you are ready, obtain an API Key. While you don’t need an API Key to try or use the API, we recommend you get one if you are planning to use the API on a regular basis. For more information on API Keys, see the [API Reference page](/getting_started/api_basics/reference/)."

  - "### Making a simple API call":
    - "You can call the API from a web browser. Simply type a valid API query in your browser’s address bar and press the Enter key."
    - "In the example below, we are searching the records in the drug adverse events endpoint for matches with 'nationwide' in the 'distribution_pattern' field. We are requesting to see the first 5 records that match."
    - "image=/img/food_enforcement_query.png"

  - "#### Some key pointers":
    - ul:
      - "An openFDA API query always begins with the base endpoint, which in this case is: https://api.fda.gov/food/enforcement.json"
      - "Searches have a special syntax: `search=field:term`."
      - "Unless otherwise specified, the API will return only one matching record for a search. You can specify the number of records to be returned by using the limit parameter. The maximum limit allowed is 99 for any single API call. If no limit is set, the API will return one matching record."

  - "#### Some advanced topics":
    - "It is possible to construct very complex queries using the openFDA API. See the [API Basics page](/getting_started/api_basics/) to learn more about all the available query parameters, how to handle quotations, spaces, phrase matches, and groupings, how to search on dates and ranges, and more."
    - "Here are a few additional tips just to get you started"
    - ul:
      - "`search=field:term+AND+field:term`: Search for records that match both terms"
      - "`search=field:term+field:term`: Search for records that match either of the two terms"
      - "`count=field`: Use the count parameter to count how often a term appears in the dataset"
      - "`search=field:term&count=another_field`: Search for matching records. Then within that set of records, count the number of times that the unique values of a field appear. Instead of looking at individual records, you can use the [count] parameter to count how often certain terms (like drug names or patient reactions) appear in the matching set of records."

  - "### Example API Queries":
    - "To help get you started, we have provided some API query examples below. Use the Run query button to call the API and get back results. You can experiment by editing the example queries in the black text box."
    - queryExplorer: oneReport
    - queryExplorer: hazard
    - queryExplorer: voluntaryVsMandated

  - "### Explore the API with an interactive chart":
    - "Use the interactive chart below to explore the dataset and to learn how you can construct different API queries."

  - "### Understanding the API Results":
    - 'For `search` queries (such as: [https://api.fda.gov/food/enforcement.json?search=classification:"Class+III"](https://api.fda.gov/food/enforcement.json?search=classification:"Class+III"), the `results` section includes matching enforcement reports returned by the API.'
    - "Each enforcement report consists of two sets of fields:"
    - ul:
      - "**Enforcement report data**"
      - "**An openfda section:** Details on the patient who experienced the event, such as age, weight, sex, etc."
    - "The data format of RES enforcement reports changed in June 2012. In openFDA API results, reports from before that time do not contain the following fields:"
    - ul:
      - "`event_id`"
      - "`status`"
      - "`city`"
      - "`state`"
      - "`country`"
      - "`voluntary_mandated`"
      - "`initial_firm_notification`"
      - "`recall_initiation_date`"
    - "For count queries (such as: [https://api.fda.gov/food/enforcement.json?count=voluntary_mandated.exact](https://api.fda.gov/food/enforcement.json?count=voluntary_mandated.exact)), the results section will look something like the following:"
