- "By design, openFDA is an open system. It is built using open standards, uses open source software, and the code itself is publicly available at Github. Given the unique nature of this approach, the technical details of this system may be of interest. Accordingly, for those curious about the structure and design of the openFDA platform, we’ve created two documents that drill into the details of the architecture and technical design of openFDA, including the various software and technologies throughout the system, and how that system can be leveraged for insights. These documents are available here for download as PDFs."
- "The first document explains in detail the technical architecture, data structure, data sources, data processing and harmonization, and software stack:"

- 'The second document offers one case study in how openFDA data can be leveraged to generate insights.  It walks through a project that transparently demonstrates JSON URL queries and uses R software to visualize and explore openFDA adverse events data.  The particular example looks at an apparent association between “aspirin” and “flushing” and how the data can be misleading:'
